**Project Description :**
        The problem involves analyzing the water quality data represented by the given columns (pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic_carbon, Trihalomethanes, Turbidity, Potability) to assess the suitability of the water for specific purposes such as drinking. The objective is to identify any potential issues or deviations from regulatory standards, and determine the potability of the water based on these parameters.
